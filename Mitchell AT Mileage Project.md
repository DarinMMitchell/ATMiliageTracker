**PROJECT STEP 2
CONCEPT
AT MILAGE TRACKER**

Over 3,735 people attempted to thru hike the Appalachian Trail in 2020. This is a 155 percent increase in the past seven years. However, fewer are finishing the trail. There needs to be an application that helps the hiker to track their miles to properly plan and stay encouraged. I believe those who track their mileage will have a greater chance of finishing.

At 2087 total miles, it is important to track the miles walked and the miles remaining. It is also helpful to know the average miles walked each remaining week to reach MT Katahdin before it closes in October.

In addition, it is *imperative* to know the distance to the next place you can buy supplies, good places to camp, and post offices.

***The application will have the following functionality:***

1) How many miles left. The program will track the miles walked and subtract these miles from 2,186 miles. It will be a persistent number that will be displayed on the user’s front page.

2) How many miles walked. The program will track the miles walked. It will be a persistent number displayed under the ‘Miles’ Left’ on the user’s front page.

3) Resupply points: This will be a feature that is initiated through a button. The button, when clicked, will show the following:

			a. Distance to the next supply point
			b. The supply point mile marker (distance from Springer Mountain)
			c. The next supply point name
			d. The supply point type
						i. Hostel 
						ii. Store
						iii. Restaurant
						iv. Post office
						v. campsites
			e. Services available at each point
			f. Contact information for the supply point
			g. **LIMITATION**: Mile markers are only distance from Springer Mountain northward. SOBO’s (southbound) hikers will not be able to use this application unless they interpolate the mileage.
			h. **NICE TO ADD:** If I have time, I would like to add a catalogue where a user can click a list of all supply points listed numerically by mile marker.

**Additional Notes:**

Each user will have to create an account tied to a user name and password.
Each user’s username, mileage logged, and mileage remaining will be stored between log-ins. Each new integer will overwrite the last. The program will not store old data not use graphs.
Value to business:  At different supply points (hostels, stores, gear stores) businesses could advertise on the site. They could advertise numbers for pickups, discounts, and special services. Also, advertisements could be linked to miles.  Example: Having tracked 1000 miles may initialize a coupon for 50 percent off of an REI membership.
